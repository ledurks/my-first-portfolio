    <p id="begin"> Top 3 things to remember when you are being basic: </p>

    <ul id="list">
      <li> Starbucks and selfies are the most important things in the world </li>
      <li> Posting on social media is essential, everyone else needs to know that they are having less fun than you </li>
      <li> Winter is only one of four seasons, make the most of your winter by wearing out your entire UGG collection </li>
    </ul>

    <p id="costumetitle"> Now that you have the "top 3 thing to remember to when you are basic" down pat, here are some things to wear to become a basic girl </p>
    <ul id="costumelist">
      <li> First off, you need to buy yourself a pair of black leggings (preferably Lululemon) </li>
      <li> With every season, the weather changes. Basic girl shoes are the same. New season means new shoes. What shoes for the season, you ask? Good question.  </li>
      <li> Summer means birkenstocks or as some people call them Jesus Sandals :) Fall and Winter mean UGG boots! (get pumpeddd), I would recommend tan UGGs for fall and black UGGs for winter. Spring = Hunter Rain Boots </li>
      <li> Next, invest in an oversized comfortable sweatshirt. XL or L are both good go-tos. </li>
      <li> To every outing that you attend, bring with you a brightly colored scrunchie. This is both fashionable and comfortable. You can easily get these at American Eagle or Urban Outfitters </li>
      <li> Assuming you go to school I would recommend purchasing a Fjall Raven Kanken backpack. You can easily pretend to be from Norway and portray to everyone that you are an adventurous, sassy gal! <li>
      <li> Kate Spade is A MUST. If you don't at least have a Kate Spade wallet you are doing it wrong. Don't even try to be a basic white girl if you don't have one of these. Just no, no. Get one or leave. </li>
      <li> If you have all of the above you should be ok for now...remember, white girl outfits change every year so check back in here in a couple months for an updated costume. </li>
    </ul>
